Please do not open issues, for feature requests, suggestions, or opinions. BUG REPORTS ONLY

## Known Issues
There are a couple known issues, mainly due to being built off of Godot, and these issues existing in the engine itself.
- Steam deck controls do not work natively, you can circumvent this by setting up controller bindings to emulate keys instead, apologies.
- Physics are weird, when interacting with corners + the camera barrier
- Drop shadows jitter when playing with "Smooth Rendering"
- Several entities jitter at times.
- Blocks + coins, respawn when reloading resource packs
